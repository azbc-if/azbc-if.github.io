comment=In what is seems, what is reality, not the zero minded. \
Supposed ultimated blue !!! In the real. What has been written on sauvage. \
That is, ... Lavanguardia, in the mist... , That is, ... the wild is the rain \
That needs an umbrella. A tree of choices, not for the blind, as is ..., \
That means, not for the bohemian, not for the golden youth ? As is it were the same. \
And so... set keel to breakers ... and read the book.
